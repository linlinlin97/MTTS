# Metadata-based Multi-Task Bandits with Bayesian Hierarchical Models

This repository is the official implementation of the paper [Metadata-based Multi-Task Bandits with Bayesian Hierarchical Models](https://arxiv.org) in Python. 

>ðŸ“‹  **Abstract**: How to explore efficiently is a central problem in multi-armed bandits. In this paper, we introduce the metadata-based multi-task bandit problem, where the agent needs to solve a large number of related multi-armed bandits tasks and can leverage some task-specific features (i.e., metadata) to share knowledge across tasks. As a general framework, we propose to capture task relations through the lens of Bayesian hierarchical models, upon which a Thompson sampling algorithm is designed to efficiently learn task relations, share information, and minimize the cumulative regrets. Two concrete examples for Gaussian bandits and Bernoulli bandits are carefully analyzed. The Bayes regret for Gaussian bandits clearly demonstrates the benefits of information sharing with our algorithm. The proposed method is further supported by extensive experiments.

## Other Required Codes to Run the Simulation
In the folder, there are three code files which are used to conduct the siulation study under both Gaussian bandits setting and Bernoulli bandits setting.
    1. `_util.py`: helper functions
    2. `_experiement.py`: function to run the experiment under either the Gaussian bandits setting or the Bernoulli bandits setting.
